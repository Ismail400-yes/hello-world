## **Project Definition and Requirements**

**Notes for getting A:**
- Should have forms for review, login
- 3 webpages

### **Web Application Purpose:**
- To give accessibility for users to communicate to other users through group chats or personal chats in friend requests.
- To explore other group chats in the app and chat about common topics.

- **Most of these actions occur from pressing a button.**

### **Non-Functional:**
- Most functions can occur in less than a second.
- Buttons can make a cool clicking sound and move up and down.

## Basic Design of UI, Hierachy and Interactive Elements

### Colour
The colour here that I wanted to add was a basic, black, dark pink/purple colour, because it matches with the app's colour and is not prominent while messaging friends and getting disgusted or distracted by the colour, but settles the user into the calm, enjoyable setting of a nice chat with friends.

### Typography
The typography here is to be basic, or maybe fancy. I'm not too sure of what to do for it, since I'm not sure what 'vibe' I'm trying to express to in my app, but the size of each text would be reflective of its purpose. More significant text, such as headlines of significant webpages or parts of the webpage are in larger, bolder text, such as chats and vice versa.

### Image
The images in my webpage are used for a purpose. For instance, the app's icon is the button used to return to the homepage of the app, or the image of the user's profile can be tapped on to see their description for their own customisability. These images should be small, as it is not the main functionals of the website. The functionals of messaging friends through any images used will be expressed in a large size to clearly display the the image to other users.
